# lorentzTransformations

This is a simulation of lorentz transformations

# Disclaimer

Values were based off of and checked agaisnt:
1. https://www.desmos.com/calculator/2j8f6yhv9v

Positions are relative, and there's no real way to convert to real world units (at least that I know of).   
**This should be used as an example for how lorentz transformations work, not used to calculate them.**   
Go to releases to find the download, since it's a unity project and I don't know how to use lfs this rep only contains the code, and not the project itself.

# Controls
UI buttons are self explanatory.    
Left click to place a static world line.    
Right click + number to place a point.    

Transparent points/lines are the shifted versions.

# TODO
Will add control page to simulation itself.   
Have major axises move as well.   
More user-friendly options.
